<p><Strong>Summary</Strong>
  <br>â€¢	Built a command line rock, paper, scissors game in Java. Printed to the terminal are the rules and instructions. The user must input how many wins they want to play to, so if they input 5 then the user or program, whichever reaches 5 wins first, wins the game. The program then randomly picks rock, paper, or scissors from an array of choices before the user does. The user then types their choice and the program compares the choices to see who wins the round and keeps track of the score and prints it to the terminal after each round. When a player reaches the goal and wins the program prints to the terminal the final score and messages depending on wether the user won or lose. There are also some command arguments like end then the program is terminated. There is also an easter egg.</p>
